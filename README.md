# Prayer timetable

Muslim prayer timetable app for deployment on Raspberry Pi. NodeJS powered. Please note that this is at alpha stage and built specifically for my own needs.

## Features
* Prayer times
* Jamaah times
* Admin area
* User authentication
* Next prayer countdown
* Jummuah notification
* Refresh bar

## How can you help
The timetable app currently contains timetables and language packs for Dublin and Rotterdam. If you like your city / language to be included, please contact me and send your own timetable. Use examples from other cities to figure out the JSON format. You are responsible for accuracy of the data.
